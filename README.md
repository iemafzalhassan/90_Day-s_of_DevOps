## Challenge Overview

The goal of this challenge is to deepen my understanding of DevOps principles, practices, and tools that are widely used in the industry. By the end of the 90 days, I aim to have hands-on experience and practical knowledge in each area covered.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain a solid understanding of Linux and command-line operations.
- Learn version control using Git and collaboration through GitHub.
- Explore automation and configuration management tools like Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, and Terraform.
- Understand container orchestration with Kubernetes.
- Familiarize myself with cloud services, monitoring, logging, and security in the DevOps lifecycle.
