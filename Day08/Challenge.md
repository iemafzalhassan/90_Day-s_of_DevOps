## Day 8: Shell Scripting Challenge

### Tasks Completed

#### Task 1: Comments
- **Description**: Created a bash script to demonstrate the use of comments for documentation.
- **Code Example**:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # This script demonstrates the use of comments in Bash
    echo "Welcome to the Bash scripting world!"
    ```
- **Insight**: Comments are essential for maintaining and understanding scripts over time, especially when working in teams.

---

#### Task 2: Using Echo
- **Description**: Created a bash script that uses the `echo` command to display messages.
- **Code Example**:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Hello, DevOps World!"
    ```
- **Insight**: The `echo` command is a fundamental way to provide feedback to users or to debug scripts by displaying variable values.

---

#### Task 3: Variables
- **Description**: Developed a bash script that demonstrates the use of variables to store and display data.
- **Code Example**:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    greeting="Hello, DevOps Engineer!"
    name="Faisal"
    echo "$greeting My name is $name."
    ```
- **Insight**: Using variables makes scripts dynamic and adaptable to different environments and configurations.

---

#### Task 4: Using Variables for Arithmetic
- **Description**: Created a script to perform arithmetic operations using variables.
- **Code Example**:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    num1=10
    num2=20
    sum=$((num1 + num2))
    echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum."
    ```
- **Insight**: Performing calculations within scripts allows for automation of tasks that require data manipulation.

---

#### Task 5: Using Built-in Variables
- **Description**: Developed a script that utilizes built-in Bash variables to display system information.
- **Code Example**:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Current User: $USER"
    echo "Current Directory: $PWD"
    echo "Exit Status of the last command: $?"
    ```
- **Insight**: Built-in variables are invaluable for scripting, providing context and information about the execution environment.

---

#### Task 6: Using Wildcards
- **Description**: Created a bash script that lists files with a specific extension using wildcards.
- **Code Example**:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Listing all .txt files:"
    ls *.txt
    ```
- **Insight**: Wildcards simplify file management by allowing batch operations on multiple files, enhancing script efficiency.
