# üìÖ Day 05: Advanced Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers with User Management

### Summary:
On the 5th day of my #90DaysOfDevOps challenge, I focused on essential Linux tasks like creating multiple directories, automating backups, user management through shell scripting, and scheduling automated backups using cron jobs.

---

## üöÄ **Tasks Completed:**

### 1. **Create Multiple Directories Using Shell Script:**

In this task, I created a shell script that takes multiple directory names as input from the user and creates them all at once. This is useful for quickly setting up multiple project directories.

#### Example Script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user for the base directory name

echo "Enter the base name for the directories:"
read base_name

# Prompt the user for the number of directories to create
echo "How many directories do you want to create?"
read number_of_dirs

# Create the specified number of directories

for i in $(seq -f "%02g" 1 $number_of_dirs); do
    # Create directory name in the format "base_name01", "base_name02", etc.
    dir_name="${base_name}${i}"  
    mkdir -p "$dir_name"
    echo "Directory '$dir_name' created successfully!"
done

```
- This script takes multiple directory names from the user, creates each directory, and confirms their creation.

### 2. **Create a Script to Backup All Your Work:**

This task involved creating a shell script to back up a source directory into a destination folder provided as arguments. It automates the backup process for important work files.

#### Example Backup Script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Backup Script
src=$1
dest=$2

if [ -d "$src" ]; then
    echo "Starting backup of $src to $dest..."
    cp -r "$src" "$dest"
    echo "Backup completed."
else
    echo "Source directory does not exist."
fi
```
- This script takes the source and destination directories as arguments, making it a reusable tool for performing backups.

### 3. **Read About User Management:**

For this task, I explored essential user management commands in Linux. Additionally, I created a shell script to automate adding a user, setting their full name, and setting their password with masked input (showing `*` for each character typed).

#### User Management Script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter the username:"
read username

echo "Enter the full name of the user:"
read fullname

echo "Creating the user $username..."
useradd -m -s /bin/bash -c "$fullname" "$username"

echo "Enter password for $username:"
while IFS= read -p "Password: " -r -s -n 1 char; do
    if [[ $char == $'\0' ]]; then
        break
    fi
    password+="$char"
    printf "*"
done
echo

echo "$username:$password" | chpasswd

echo "User $username created with full name '$fullname' and a password has been set."
```
- This script asks for the username, full name, and password, ensuring the password input is hidden by showing `*` for each entered character.

#### Common User Management Commands:
1. **Add a User:**
   ```bash
   sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash username
   ```
   - `-m`: Creates a home directory for the user.
   - `-s /bin/bash`: Specifies the default shell for the user.

2. **Set or Change a User's Password:**
   ```bash
   sudo passwd username
   ```

3. **Modify a User Account:**
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -l new_username old_username
   ```

4. **Delete a User:**
   ```bash
   sudo userdel -r username
   ```

---

### 4. **Read About Cron and Crontab to Automate the Backup Script:**

I explored `cron` and `crontab`, which are used for scheduling repetitive tasks like daily backups. I scheduled my backup script to run automatically every day at midnight using `crontab`.

#### Example Cron Job:
```bash
crontab -e
```
- To run the backup script every day at midnight, I added this line in the crontab file:
```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/backup_script.sh /source/dir /destination/dir
```
This ensures regular backups of my work without manual intervention.

## üîç **What I Learned:**
- **Shell scripting** is an efficient way to automate tasks like creating multiple directories and backing up work files.
- **User management** in Linux is a critical skill for managing users and system security.
- **Cron jobs** are an excellent way to automate tasks on a schedule, such as daily backups.
